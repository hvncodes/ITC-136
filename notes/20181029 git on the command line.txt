git status shows the status of the staging area

git add NameOfNewScript or git add . to add those changes to the "index"
or the staging area

The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it 
is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next commit. Thus
after making any changes to the working tree, and before running the
commit command, you must use the add command to add any new or modified
files to the index.
