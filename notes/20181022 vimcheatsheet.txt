vim cheat sheet

vi newfile
	creates a new file with the name "newfile" with no extension, if you want a text file, add ".txt"
inside vi, press "i" to insert/start typing

esc -> :q! 
	to exit without saving

sudo apt-get install vim
	installs/updates vim

esc -> gg 
	brings you to the top

esc -> G
	brings you to the bottom
	
esc -> :5 
	brings us to line number 5

esc -> /text 
	to search for the phrase "text" and to tab between matches press the key 'n' or 'shift+n'

esc -> :%s/text/texty/g
	replace all "text" with "texty", remove the "%" if you only want to affect the line you are currently selecting
	
esc -> :w
	writes file into the system, basically saving the file
	
esc -> :x or zz
	exits vim and saves changes to the file if changes were made

esc -> :split FILENAME
	opens FILENAME file in a second window
	ctrl+w+w (press w twice) switches between the split windows
	something interesting I found that if you split the SAME file, edits made to one will affect both splits, 
	but that's kinda pointless since it's the same exact file and all
